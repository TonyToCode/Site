                                <p>The "Russian" in our name comes from our approach, which is based on the elite mathematics schools of the former Soviet Union and adapted for the U.S. environment. This methodology has a long and storied history of success, consistently producing many of the world's top performers in international math olympiads.</p>
                                <p class="mt-4">According to this tradition, the study of mathematics is the pre-eminent tool of mental development. For your child, this means we teach math in a way that not only builds mathematical excellence but also develops intellect and character. Our curriculum focuses on deep conceptual understanding over memorization, teaching students to think logically and creatively. This approach equips them with a powerful framework for problem-solving that will benefit them far beyond mathematics.</p>

                                <p>Finding the perfect fit is essential for a student's confidence and growth. Our placement process is comprehensive and free of charge. It begins with a multi-part evaluation that assesses not just a student's computational skills but also their logical reasoning and problem-solving abilities.</p>
                                <p class="mt-4">Following the evaluation, we have a detailed discussion with you and your child to understand their goals, learning style, and previous experience. Based on both the evaluation results and this conversation, we recommend a specific program and levelâ€”whether it's building a foundation for the AMC 8 or tackling the advanced concepts required for the AIME.</p>
